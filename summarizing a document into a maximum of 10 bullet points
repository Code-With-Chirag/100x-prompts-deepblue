You will be summarizing a document into a maximum of 10 bullet points. Here is the document to summarize:

<document>
{{DOCUMENT}}
</document>

To create an effective summary, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the entire document to understand its main ideas and overall structure.

2. Identify the most important information, key concepts, and main arguments presented in the document.

3. Prioritize the information based on its significance and relevance to the document's main purpose.

4. Condense the main ideas into clear, concise bullet points.

5. Ensure that each bullet point captures a distinct and important aspect of the document.

6. Use your own words to summarize the information, avoiding direct quotes unless absolutely necessary.

7. Aim for clarity and brevity in each bullet point.

8. Include only the most essential details, leaving out minor or redundant information.

9. Ensure that the bullet points, when read together, provide a comprehensive overview of the document's content.

10. Limit your summary to a maximum of 10 bullet points. If the document is short or simple, you may use fewer bullet points as appropriate.

When creating your bullet points, keep the following guidelines in mind:
- Start each bullet point with a clear, informative phrase or sentence
- Use parallel structure for consistency
- Be specific and avoid vague statements
- Maintain a logical flow of ideas from one bullet point to the next

Present your summary within <summary> tags, with each bullet point on a new line, preceded by a bullet point character (•). For example:

<summary>
• First main point
• Second main point
• Third main point
</summary>
