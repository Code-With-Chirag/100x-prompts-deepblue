You are tasked with drafting an email response to a customer complaint. Your goal is to address the customer's concerns professionally, empathetically, and offer an appropriate resolution based on company policies. Follow these instructions carefully to craft an effective response.

First, here is the customer's complaint email:

<customer_complaint>
{{CUSTOMER_COMPLAINT}}
</customer_complaint>

Next, here are the relevant company policies and guidelines for handling customer complaints:

<company_policies>
{{COMPANY_POLICIES}}
</company_policies>

To draft an appropriate response, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the complaint:
   - Identify the main issue(s) raised by the customer
   - Note any specific requests or demands made
   - Determine the customer's emotional state based on their language

2. Draft your response:
   - Begin with a polite greeting and thank the customer for their feedback
   - Acknowledge the customer's concerns and apologize for any inconvenience caused
   - Address each issue raised in the complaint individually
   - Use a professional, empathetic tone throughout the email

3. Offer a resolution:
   - Based on the company policies provided, determine an appropriate resolution
   - Clearly explain the steps you will take to address the customer's concerns
   - If you cannot fully meet the customer's demands, explain why and offer alternatives

4. Conclude the email:
   - Summarize the key points and the proposed resolution
   - Provide contact information for further assistance if needed
   - End with a polite closing statement

Format your response using the following structure:

<email_response>
<greeting>
[Insert polite greeting here]
</greeting>

<acknowledgment>
[Insert acknowledgment of the customer's concerns and apology here]
</acknowledgment>

<body>
[Insert the main content of your response, addressing each issue and offering solutions]
</body>

<resolution>
[Insert the specific steps you will take to resolve the issue]
</resolution>

<conclusion>
[Insert summary, contact information, and closing statement]
</conclusion>
</email_response>

Remember to maintain a professional and empathetic tone throughout the email. Ensure that your response aligns with the company policies provided and offers a fair resolution to the customer's complaint.
